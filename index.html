        <h3>Identification of VALUE</h3>
        <p>We identify in collaboration with our business partners their understanding about what value means, and to whom.</p>
        <p>The outcome is an explicit and common vocabulary, so taking away subjectivity and misunderstandings.</p>

        <h3>Decision Support for VALUE</h3>
        <p>Each stakeholder assesses the impact that the implementation of a particular set of decisions will have from the identified VALUE factors.</p>
        <p>The VALUE Tool provides a dashboard to provide different visualizations to guide discussions and decisions.</p>
