        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Despite the efforts to pinpoint the effects of applying TDD, there are still many unknowns about it, posing important challenges with highly practical impact. This project will address these challenges with the goal of understanding the dynamics of test-driven development through empirical studies (controlled experiments and case studies) with students and professionals using a variety of realistic tasks, and replicating the studies over the course of the project to achieve a proper sample size. The factors listed above will be controlled for in the analyses, especially the process conformance argument, and finally recommender tools will be developed for easier adoption of TDD.</p>
