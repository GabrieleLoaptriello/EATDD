        <h3>Identification of VALUE</h3>
        <p>We identify, in collaboration with our business partners, the factors that they use intrinsically in their decision making, which represent their understanding about what Value means, and to whom.</p>
        <p>The outcome is an explicit set of Value Factors that represent the viewpoints from different stakeholders. Such outcome also provides a common vocabulary, so taking away subjectivity and misunderstandings.</p>

        <h3>Decision Support for VALUE</h3>
        <p>Using the VALUE Tool, each stakeholder estimates the impact that they believe the implementation of a particular set of features/ideas/requirements/etc will likely have upon each of the previously identified VALUE factors.</p>
        <p>The VALUE Tool also provides a dashboard that presents the aggregated views from different stakeholders using numerous visualization techniques. These visualizations aim to support stakeholders’ discussions and decisions.</p>

        <h3>Prediction of VALUE</h3>
        <p>The end goal of VALUE is to provide a solution, using Bayesian Network, where past aggregated data from decision making meetings, combined with basic research on automatic uncertainty quantification, can be used to provide the overall value of a feature/idea/requirement/etc being discussed, in case it is selected for implementation into an existing product/project. The technique chosen – Bayesian Network, enables the representation of the uncertainty that is inherent to decision making scenarios and experts’ knowledge.</p>
